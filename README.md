# Suspicious-Object-Detection
The aim of the project is to design real-time video-based application based on Deep Learning and OpenCV that will detect a suspicious object in a steady environment. 
The application will account for the dimensions of the detected object and if dimensions are relatively smaller then it canâ€™t pose a threat. Otherwise, it will make an alarming sound, start recording and inform the user as well (via email).   
The final detected object recording can be stored for future reference.

Our project primarily aims to reduce memory load on CCTVs. 
	Only that part of the surveillance is stored for future reference where a possible threat is detected, hence the primary aim is served. 
	To  pre-empt treachery through  real time alarms  and mail alerts for suspicious behaviours.
	It can be used for surveillance in ATMs, only when a person is actively withdrawing money, the application will keep a record.
The application can keep a count of the number of people present in the frame, which in turn with slight modifications, can check if people are following social distancing.
Adding a class 'Masks' to the dataset used for object detection, it can be detected whether people are wearing masks or not.
This can also be used to keep a check on any break-ins into places prohibited for people and animals.
